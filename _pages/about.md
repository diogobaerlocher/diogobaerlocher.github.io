I'm a macroeconomist interested in economic growth and development. I joined the [Department of Economics](https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/economics/) of the University of South Florida in the fall of 2019, after receiving my Ph.D. from the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. In my research, I seek to understand why some countries are richer than others focusing on the role of government and demographic dynamics. Recently, I'm also interested in the interplay between geography and sub-national economic development.

My research has been published in top-field journals such as _Economic Theory_ and _Public Choice_. Before receiving my Ph.D, I also published papers on top Brazilian journals, mostly on the topics of taxation and fiscal shocks. I have experience teaching _Economic Growth_ and _Intermediate Macroeconomics_ at the undergraduate level, and _Macroeconomics_ at the graduate level.

**Field of Interest:** Economic growth and Development; Public economics; Demographic economics
