abstract     : "What is the difference between persistence and path dependence? We use two interrelated historical episodes---the development of the gold roads and the mule road network in Brazil---that determined the initial distribution of population to show a clear case where there is path dependence without persistence from the initial shock. We find that these historical pathways are causally associated with population density, population growth with in-migration, urbanization, and structural change through time in a pattern more consistent with multiple equilibria and path dependence, instead of historical persistence. Using the pathways as instruments in an economic geography model with historical and contemporaneous agglomeration spillovers supports this conclusion."
