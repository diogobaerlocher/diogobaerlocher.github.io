abstract     : "We show that historical pathways from Brazil's gold rush era still impact today's population distribution. Furthermore, we find that these pathways shaped the initial urban configuration and population settlement, contributing to the heterogeneous evolution of impacted locations. We identify a causal relationship between the pathways and various demographic indicators, including population density, population growth via in-migration, urbanization, and structural change over time. The findings reveal patterns more consistent with path dependence rather than historical persistence. The empirical quantification of an economic geography model using our estimated agglomeration spillovers implies that the forces driving population dynamics lie in the path-dependence region."
